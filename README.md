# Vue Time Machine ‚ö°Ô∏è

This is the code for my talk about a time machine built in Vue.js
The game is not thrown together quickly, it's probably not well done. The focus here lies on the time machine.

- [Time machine v2](https://github.com/themarcba/vue-timemachine/tree/v2)

## Demo

In the talk I mentioned another talk I gave about building a time machine using JavaScript proxies.
